# About Me

I’m a Senior iOS Engineer who believes that great mobile experiences shouldn’t just work—they should feel effortless while being engineered for scale and reliability.

Over the past few years, I’ve had the privilege of building iOS applications that serve millions of users, from enhancing e-commerce platforms at Visma to architecting scalable solutions in the automotive industry at OLX Group. My journey has taken me through the complete spectrum of iOS development, from refining system architectures and implementing cutting-edge technologies like SwiftUI and Combine, to mentoring teams and conducting technical interviews for senior-level positions.

## What Drives Me

I’m fascinated by the intersection of clean architecture patterns and user experience. Whether I’m breaking down complex systems into maintainable, testable modules or collaborating with cross-functional teams to bring innovative features to life, I’m always focused on creating mobile experiences that users love and developers can build upon.

My expertise spans the modern iOS ecosystem—Swift, SwiftUI, Swift Concurrency, Combine, TCA, and MVVM—but what excites me most is how these technologies can be orchestrated to solve real-world problems elegantly.

## Beyond the Code

When I’m not architecting iOS applications, you’ll find me exploring creative coding projects. I’ve built everything from **Timeric**, a sophisticated timer app with custom widgets, to **Cellular Life Automaton**, a playful take on Conway’s Game of Life, and even **Lightmorse**, an app that converts text to morse code using your iPhone’s flashlight. These projects reflect my belief that technology should be both functional and fun.

## Let’s Connect

I’m always excited to discuss engineering topics overall, mostly iOS development , share insights about scalable mobile architecture, or any AI related topic. Whether you’re looking to collaborate on a project or just want to chat about the latest in iOS development, I’d love to hear from you.

# AI Thoughts

AI is here to stay, period. Unlike fleeting technologies that burst onto the scene, go viral, and disappear just as quickly, AI represents a fundamental shift that will become deeply integrated into our daily lives.

Most of us have already interacted with GPT models like ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, and Claude. Many have also explored design-focused AI tools such as DALL-E and Gemini’s Veo 3.

These tools have proven incredibly valuable. I find myself turning to Google Search less frequently, and as a software engineer, Stack Overflow has become nearly obsolete (its decline since AI models launched speaks volumes). The ability to receive faster, more constructive responses is invaluable and saves countless hours.

# What Should We Do?

Fear is a powerful emotion—perhaps the strongest of all. The uncertainty about whether AI will eliminate our jobs and how we’ll earn a living in a world dominated by robots and AI agents can feel overwhelming.

Let’s step back and examine our history. During the Industrial Revolution of the 1700s-1800s, vast amounts of manual labor became obsolete. This trend accelerated during the Second Industrial Revolution from the 1850s through World War I. Yet humanity adapted, using these new tools to propel society forward.

The lesson here is clear: we must embrace change and leverage these tools to advance even further.

I believe the next phase will involve a fusion of human capabilities and AI technology. As we integrate AI more deeply into our daily routines, our productivity could increase exponentially—potentially by 1000%.

Consider a company with 100 software engineers. If that company fully embraces AI, will it lay off 50 engineers and have the remaining 50 work alongside AI? Or will it retain all 100 engineers and accomplish three years’ worth of planning in a single year?

I’m confident the second scenario is more likely. Companies will use AI agents as companions, not replacements.

Since AI is here to stay, you should learn to harness its full potential. In software engineering, for instance, AI capabilities currently match those of a junior engineer. This doesn’t mean companies will stop hiring junior developers—rather, it means junior engineers must master these tools to deliver at higher levels.

As a software engineer, I consider it essential not only to use these tools but to understand how to use them effectively. Future hiring processes will expect engineers to demonstrate proficiency in working alongside AI agents, making it crucial to invest time in learning these skills now.

Ultimately, the message is simple: embrace AI and learn as much as possible. AI will become a tool to help you achieve remarkable things—just as this keyboard I’m typing on has enabled me to share these insights while my pen and paper remain untouched in the drawer.
